### Converting pyboostcard to R

Python is great for typing support but it is severely lacking when it comes to fitting models

 - Sklearn cannot fit regularized classification models with a positive coeffecient constraint
 - glmnet on Conda is not available for Windows
 - R has native NA support for every vector type -- and everything is vectorized

Porting everything to R. Almost done.
